Porter scored just eight points going two for seven from the floor and two for four from the free-throw line.  Porter did try to make up for his lack of scoring by also getting nine boards and two steals.  Since coming back from injury Porter has averaged 14.2 points, 4.8 rebounds, and two assists.  This is up almost four points a game from Porter's career average and is most likely due to the absence of point guard John  Wall and the increased scoring production from Porter should continue for the foreseeable future.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/otto-porter-gets-limited-opportunities\/596660","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.
