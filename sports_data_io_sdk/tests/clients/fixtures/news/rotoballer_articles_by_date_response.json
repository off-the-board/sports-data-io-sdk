Beal finished just 2-for-10 from beyond the arc, but collected 36 points, 10 rebounds and nine assists across his 45 minutes. It was another massive performance for Beal, who continues to log huge minutes totals and lead the Washington offense on a nightly basis. Hell get a favorable match-up Monday against the up-tempo Sacramento Kings, looking to keep his shot attempts sky-high, having fired up at least 19 in each of his last eight outings.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/bradley-beal-nearly-logs-triple-double-in-clutch-outing\/611021","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.
