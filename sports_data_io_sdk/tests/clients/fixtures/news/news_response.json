[{"NewsID":56876,"Source":"RotoBaller","Updated":"2019-06-21T00:08:26","TimeAgo":"2 days ago","Title":"Cleveland Cavaliers Select Darius Garland","Content":"The Cleveland Cavaliers have drafted Vanderbilt point guard Darius Garland with the fifth pick in the 2019 NBA Draft. This is the second year in a row that the Cavaliers have gone point guard, but expect Cleveland to play both Garland and last years pick, Collin Sexton, together in the backcourt. Garland played in just five games for Vanderbilt before a knee injury ended his college career, but in that time he averaged 16.2 points per game while attempting 4.6 threes and making 47.8 percent of them. Garland can play both on and off the ball, and his long term outlook should see him be the main offensive option for Cleveland, though hes likely to cede a lot of ball-handling duties to Sexton early on, hurting his value in fantasy re-draft leagues. Garlands small college sample also makes projecting a lot of things a mystery. Will he keep up the shooting efficiency? Will he display more aptitude as a passer? There are definite risks here, but a lot of upside.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/cleveland-cavaliers-select-darius-garland\/645134","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.

Warren Traded To Indiana","Content":"The Phoenix Suns have traded T.J. Warren and the 32nd pick in this year's NBA Draft to the Indiana Pacers in exchange for cash considerations. In Warren, the Pacers add a young player who averaged 18 points per game last year while shooting 42.8 percent on 4.2 three-point attempts per game. Warren can be a solid role player for the Pacers, and with rumors swirling that Bojan Bogdanovic might not be back in a Pacers uniform next year, Warren can slide into the starting lineup if necessary to provide the team with a solid wing option. His fantasy value should be on the rise, as he's now looking at a solid role on a good team instead of an uncertain role on a Suns team that seems to be in flux right now.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/t-j-warren-traded-to-indiana\/645099","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.

While Conley's never made an All-Star team, he's been an excellent point guard for Memphis for years and is coming off a 2018-19 season in which averaged a career-high 21.1 points per game for the Grizzlies while adding in 6.4 assists, 1.3 steals, and 3.4 rebounds. Conley will slide into the starting role occupied by Ricky Rubio last year, and while his scoring could take a step back as he won't need to be the primary scoring option on a team that has Donovan Mitchell, the Jazz are set up great for Conley to put up his best season in terms of assists. Less need to be the team's main scorer can also allow Conley to refocus on defense and gives him the potential to get his steals average back up around two per game. All in all, Conley's in a good spot, even if his scoring drops by a few points per game back to the high teens.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/mike-conley-traded-to-utah\/644752","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.

Gasol connected on just 1-for-9 shooting to score just two points and has now shot just 3-for-21 in the series first two games. Gasol did not add much else either as he had five rebounds with an assist and a block across 19 minutes of action. Gasol took the blame after the game for the Raptors slow start which led them to be fighting from the behind for the entirety of the game. Serge  Ibaka did show some promise off the bench as he scored eight points with 10 rebounds in 29 minutes of action.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/marc-gasols-offensive-struggles-continue\/634837","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.

Curry had the hot hand as he nailed four triples and five shots overall en route to 16 points and had four big steals with a rebound and two assists. Curry was a game-high plus-13 and this cannot be overlooked with his massive impact on this night. Curry will definitely see an uptick in minutes in Game 3 as the Blazers had success with smaller lineups, making this Curry brother a serious play for the next match in this series.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/seth-curry-plays-excellent-minutes-in-game-2-loss\/634520","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.

Gasol did salvage his night with 12 rebounds, five assists and two blocks across 40 minutes of action. Gasol did an excellent job early on being the second player in defensive traps but this led to Brook  Lopez having some extra space to find his footing for his big night. The positive was that Gasol took his second most shot attempts of the postseason and if he continues this aggressive approach in Game 2 and the shots fall, then he could be in for an even better line.","Url":"https:\/\/www.rotoballer.com\/player-news\/marc-gasol-struggles-on-offense-grabs-12-rebounds\/634223","TermsOfUse":"RotoBaller news feed is provided for limited commercial and non-commercial use.
